What do you know about Deloitte?

Throughout my undergraduate education, I constantly followed Deloitte's work and was intrigued by the firm's recent development, particularly the acquisition of Terbium Labs.
Since its founding in London in 1845, Deloitte has developed tremendously. One of the Big Four, Deloitte is regarded as one of the largest privately held professional services firms.

I am confident in my ability to assist Deloitte in continuing to expand and better the lives of millions of people around the world.
